# VS Code Extension: OptiDev Terminals

## Usage

### Terminals View

2. Use the "+" button to create a new terminal
3. Each terminal displays quick actions on hover:
   - Start: runs the terminal with configured command
   - Stop: terminates the terminal
   - Edit: opens the modification form
   - Delete: removes the configuration (with confirmation)

### Creating/Editing a Terminal

1. A modern form opens in a tab
2. Fill in:
   - Terminal name
   - Command to execute
   - Auto-start option
3. Multiple terminals can be edited simultaneously
4. Changes are applied immediately

### Default Configuration

- **terminals**: `[]` (array of terminal configurations)

### Configuration Format

```json
{
  "optiDev.terminals": [
    {
      "name": "Dev Server",
      "command": "npm run dev",
      "start": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Tests",
      "command": "npm run test",
      "start": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Migration

If you were using a previous version of the extension, you don't need to do anything special - your configurations will be automatically migrated to the new format on next startup. The extension will preserve:
- All your terminal configurations
- Auto-start settings
- Command definitions
- Workspace-specific settings

This ensures a zero-configuration transition to the new interface while maintaining all your existing workflows.

## What's New

This redesign brings several improvements to enhance your terminal management experience:

- **Streamlined Interface**: New sidebar view with all terminals and actions in one place
- **Quick Actions**: Directly accessible controls for each terminal (start, stop, edit, delete)
- **Multi-Terminal Management**: Edit multiple terminals simultaneously in separate tabs
- **Modern Forms**: Enhanced terminal configuration interface
- **Improved Feedback**: Clear visual indicators and confirmations for all actions

All these improvements come without breaking changes to your existing configurations or workflows.

## Initial Setup

If no terminals are configured, the extension will prompt you to create one at startup. You can also:

1. Open the OptiDev Terminals view
2. Click the "+" button to create a new terminal
3. Configure your terminals as needed

## Notes

- Each workspace can have its own configuration
- Settings are saved in workspace settings
- Interface adapts to VS Code theme
- Terminal actions are context-aware and accessible
- Multiple terminal configurations can be managed simultaneously
